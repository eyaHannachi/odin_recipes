A little HTML/CSS project to get started with the basics of web development.
And while i needed to google things here and there, I did find it easy to do things on my own. It is quite nice to reap the fruits of your own labor and hard work.

This project does a very good job at setting the scene for you, as a summary of all the lessons you've learned. The best thing about it is its creative aspect. Every recipe created is unique and authentic to its creator.

After working on this, I find myself capable with working with the basics of HTML and CSS. And while the work isn't extraordinary, it is enough for a beginner.

The only way to go from here is up.
