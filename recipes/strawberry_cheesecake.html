            <p>Eating cheesecakes for the first time was a life-changing experience for me.
         There is something so extraordinary that you don't find in any other type of cake.
            </p>
    <p>And since strawberry is my favorite fruit, I decided: "why not both?"</p>
    <p>This strawberry cheesecake recipe is one of the easiest, most delicious and most fun
        dishes to make. Even better when you master it.</p>
